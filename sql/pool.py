    '''
    A Base Pool clase used by this program, instead of the built-in class Pool of aiomysql, 
    this class provide the common function for program

    The pool will be global for all SQLPool instance once created. And it's impossible to 
    use this class to create two different single pool. In this case, it will sure that there 
    are only one pool actived at the same time when program is running.

    Different to pool. Cursor and Conn(Connection) are instance-limited. Each SQLPool instance 
    can has most 1 conn and cursor each time.(Actually in this class a cursor is tightly 
    bound together, in common you shouldn't operate the conn, conn will be distribute or 
    delete autoly when you create or delete cursor)

    Common used:
    create, get_cursor, release_cursor
